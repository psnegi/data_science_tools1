* Course Description
It is recommended that you consult this github page often for material related to this course. You should check your e-mail periodically for messages.
Assignments will be upload here and in the [[https://canvas.du.edu/login/ldap][canvas]].

The main objective of data science tools 1 is to learn various tools to perform data analysis. Focus in tool1 is data cleanup, summarization ,and visualization.
It is more like a hacking skill set but our primary focus will be on the scientific python  and Linux ecosystem. We'll use [[http://jupyter.org/][jupyter notebook/lab]] for in the class and homeworks. This should make our learning interactive.

For the final project, students will work through  individual or team projects applying course-work
to the  data lifecycle within a particular domain. The focus will also be
on best data science/software engineering practices and reproducible work.

*Please select  a project by January 20th  as per your preference. You are allowed to have a group of 2 to 3 students but project work must justify team count.* There will be a homework asking about the detail of your final project. We'll provide feedback about feasibility of the final project.
*Final projects, Can be based on initial capstone work?. Please let us know if this is the case. We need to go over details.*

** Syllabus
*This syllabus is subject to change at the discretion of the instructor*.
- Jupyter Notebook for reproducible workflow.
- Data science and EDA.
- Git tools work flow.
- Data science at command prompt. Linux command line, bash,  basic awk and sed.
- Data collection and ingestion(web scrapping and reading datasets + pandas).
- Data cleanup and imputation + Pandas.
- Data summarization and visualization+ panda(groupby, apply, aggregate etc).
- Go over some some topics as per students demands.
- more to come

 *Linux command line and scientific python ( primarily numpy, matplotlib, request, seaborn, basic pandas) will be used throughout the course.*

* Grading
*There will be  coding/analysis homework assignments, midterm and a final project. We'll drop one of your worst assignment grade*.

There will be a final presentation of the final project.
You will be required to  submit a final project report in the jupyter notebook format.

* Software Installation
** Python
We want everybody to have same experience using computational tools in data science tools 1. Please follow steps as
per your operating system.

*** Window based installation
Please install Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) on window 10. Follow the instruction in this post [[https://medium.com/hugo-ferreiras-blog/using-windows-subsystem-for-linux-for-data-science-9a8e68d7610c][Using Windows Subsystem for Linux for Data Science]]
by Hugo Ferreira for installing Linux. **ignore install Anaconda part.**

You can also watch this [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cvrqmq9A3tA][video]] to see installation of Windows 10 Bash & Linux Subsystem Setup.
** Linux /Mac users should already have bash command prompt
You can run *echo $0* to check current shell. Change to bash shell using  *chsh -s /bin/bash*

*One you are in Linux/Mac bash command prompt, Please follow following instructions*
** Python3 installation
Please follow instructions [[https://realpython.com/installing-python/][here]] to install python3 if it is not installed in your system. This link
also lists Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) for window 10(Windows 10 Creators or Anniversary Update).
I am using python 3.5.2. Hopefully any version of python 3 should work.

*** creating virtual environment and installing packages for data science tools 1
*Run following commands from  command prompt.*

- *apt-get install python3-venv*
- Using command line(*cd command*), go to the folder where you want to keep python file, notebooks related to this course.
- run **python3 -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment**
  + e.g. I ran *python3 -m venv dst1_env*
- To activate you environment run *source /path/to/new/virtual/environment/bin/activate*
  + e.g From this course directory I run, *source dst1_env/bin/activate*

- run *python3 -m pip install -- upgrade pip*. Note that there are 2 dash in upgrade option.
- run *wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/psnegi/data_science_tools1/master/requirements.txt*
- run *pip install -r requirements.txt*
- run *jupyter notebook* or *jupyter lab*. 
- In the browser you should see your current files.
- Click on the notebook you want to run.

- click on *RISE* slideshow extension in notebook, if you want to see notebook as slideshow.

To deactivate  python virtual environment, run *deactivate*

*** Python learning resources
You can also go to my  [[https://github.com/psnegi/PythonForReproducibleResearch][python for reproducible research]]  github repository and start by running pythonBasic.ipynb notebook.
I will go over basic of python and jupyter notebook.
